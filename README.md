# eXNVerify

eXNVerify (Exon and SNV verifier) is a Python tool for extraction and verification of genome sequence fragments coverage quality and presents the results of analysis in an intuitive way for genetic diagnostician. Two executables from this repository takes mosdepth- or bedtools-generated BED file as the whole genome/exome sequence coverage and is are able to:
1. generate detailed verfication of pathogenic germline and somatic single nucletide variants for chosen gene(s)
2. analyse the whole genome sequence coverage and evalute all pathogenic germline and SNV coverage quality
